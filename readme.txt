Prevent not logged users from downloading the elements of your media library that you decide to keep private.


== Description ==

### Restricted Media, Pages and Posts will be dismissed soon: so please, download our new [NutsForPress Restricted Contents](https://wordpress.org/plugins/nutsforpress-restricted-contents/) and find there all the Restricted Media, Pages and Posts features

Install and activate **Restricted Media, Pages and Posts** plugin and you can easily mark as restricted: images, pdf file, zip files, pages, posts and custom posts, deciding to grant access to a specific role or to any logged-in users.

Mark as restricted your **media** by the checkbox that you'll find at the right sidebar of the selected element, copy and paste the provided alternative URL to link your media into pages and posts.

When "Is restricted" checkbox is flagged, the selected element will get downloadable only to logged-in users and only through the alternative URL (original URL will be protected through a htaccess rule). When "Is restricted" checkbox is not flagged, the media element will be downloadable for anyone, through both the original and the alternative URL.

Mark as restricted your **pages and posts** too by the checkbox that you'll find at the right sidebar of the post/page editor.

If a not logged-in user tries to acces to a restricted content, he will be redirected to homepage or to the page you have defined into "Restricted Media, Pages and Posts" plugin options.Â 

Furthermore, you can grant access to media, post or pages only to a specific role or to every logged-in users: chose from the dropdown menu, just after the "is restricted" checkbox.

That's it! Simple, effective and safe.

In association with [Main Entrance](https://wordpress.org/plugins/main-entrance/), Restricted Media, Pages and Posts helps you to build a restricted content page, for allowing to download documents only to logged in users.
